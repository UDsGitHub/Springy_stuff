# Springy_stuff
Play around the with spring systems i developed for python using the pygame module.

There are several files included in this. The first of which you should test is the springy ball.

This code is supposed to serve as an appetite setter for the remaining codes to come. it showcases a ball/circle attached to a pivot/square via a spring/line. it is a visual representation of hooke's law... without too much visual pizzaz.

The next code to check out is called the stretchy_springy. this code showcases what it would look like to array multiple spring balls in a vertical line straight down. the code can also me modified to a horizontal line with points pinned to the display. Besides this, the code creates a visualization of the core of "rope physics".

Last but not least, take a look at the spring mesh code. This code showcases the stretchy_springy arrayed in a gridlike fashion to form a mesh. This mesh behaves like a cloth, giving the illusion of a cloth simulation.

Thank you and Have fun!
